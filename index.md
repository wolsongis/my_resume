## Projects
<a id="projects"></a>
**Panthers and Wildlife Crossings** 
<br>
<br>
Collaborative project presented through Esri's StoryMaps which examines the relationship between wildlife crossings, average daily traffic counts, and Florida panther deaths in the Florida Panther Focus area. Ultimately attempts to determine the effectiveness of wildlife crossings in preventing panther-vehicle collisions through analysis in ArcGIS, as well as identify suitable locations for future construction of wildlife crossings.

<br>
**Solar Energy Site Analysis** 
<br>
<br>
Utilized ArcGIS Pro to analyze geospatial data for identifying optimal sites for energy development. Conducted land use assessments, a roadway proximity analysis, slope evaluation and a sunshade analysis. Based on these parameters I developed a binary and a ranking suitability model to support solar energy planning and provide a reference for future solar planning projects.
